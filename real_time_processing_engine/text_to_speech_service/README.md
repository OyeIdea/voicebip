# Text-to-Speech (TTS) Service

## Purpose

The Text-to-Speech (TTS) Service is a component of the RevoVoiceAI Real-Time Processing Engine. Its core responsibility is to convert textual input into natural-sounding audible speech. This service is crucial for generating voice responses in a conversational AI system.

## Core Functions (Conceptual)

*   **Text Normalization/Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares input text for synthesis (e.g., expanding abbreviations, handling numbers, correcting punctuation).
*   **Speech Synthesis**: Uses a TTS model or engine to convert the processed text into raw audio waveforms. This can involve selecting different voices or speaking styles.
*   **Audio Encoding**: Encodes the raw audio into a desired output format (e.g., WAV, MP3) and bitrate.

## Components

*   `service.py`: Contains the main `TextToSpeechService` class. Its `synthesize_speech()` method orchestrates the TTS process, including text preprocessing, core synthesis, and audio encoding.
*   `config.py`: (Placeholder) Intended for service-specific configurations, such as paths to TTS models, voice preferences, supported output formats, or API keys for cloud-based TTS engines.
*   `voices/`: (Placeholder directory) Could store voice model files, custom voice configurations, or related assets for on-premise TTS engines.
*   `__init__.py`: Makes the directory a Python package.

## Interaction in the Conversational AI Pipeline

The TTS Service typically acts at the end of the response generation phase:

1.  **Input**: Receives plain text, usually from the Dialogue Management (DM) service. This text represents the system's intended verbal response to the user.
2.  **Processing**: The `TextToSpeechService.synthesize_speech()` method is called with the text.
    *   The text is preprocessed.
    *   A TTS engine/model synthesizes the audio.
    *   The audio is encoded into the desired format.
3.  **Output**: Produces audio data as a byte stream.
4.  **Next Step**: This audio data is then typically streamed or sent to the Voice Gateway Layer to be played back to the user over their communication channel (e.g., phone call, web interface).

This service will eventually integrate with specific TTS engines (e.g., WaveNet, Tacotron 2, or cloud-based TTS APIs like Google Cloud TTS, Amazon Polly).
