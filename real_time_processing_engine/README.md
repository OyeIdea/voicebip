# RevoVoiceAI - Real-Time Processing Engine

This directory contains the services that form the core of the Real-Time Processing Engine for RevoVoiceAI. These services are responsible for handling live audio input and output, performing initial processing, and orchestrating interactions with the AI/ML layer.

## Services

Currently, the following services are outlined:

*   **`speech_to_text_service`**: Responsible for transcribing audio streams into text.
*   **`streaming_data_manager`**: Manages incoming data streams (e.g., audio from calls) and routes them to appropriate processing services.
*   **`text_to_speech_service`**: Converts textual responses into audible speech.
*   *(Other services like VAD, Audio Processing Pipeline might be added here later)*

## Conceptual Full Voice Interaction Flow

A typical flow for a complete voice interaction:

1.  **Call Initiation / Voice Input**:
    *   An external component (like a Voice Gateway) signals the start of a new audio stream (e.g., an incoming call).
    *   The `StreamingDataManager` registers this new audio stream.
2.  **Speech-to-Text (STT) Processing**:
    *   The `StreamingDataManager` routes the incoming audio stream/chunks to the `SpeechToTextService`.
    *   The `SpeechToTextService` transcribes the audio into plain text.
3.  **AI/ML Processing (External to this Engine)**:
    *   The transcribed text is passed to the AI/ML Services Layer.
    *   **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)** service processes the text to identify intents and entities.
    *   **Dialogue Management (DM)** service takes the NLU output, manages conversation state, and decides on the next action or response text.
4.  **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Processing**:
    *   The response text generated by the Dialogue Management service (from the AI/ML layer) is sent to the `TextToSpeechService` within this engine.
    *   The `TextToSpeechService` converts this text into an audio stream (e.g., WAV data).
5.  **Audio Output**:
    *   The synthesized audio stream from the TTS service is then passed to the Voice Gateway Layer (not implemented here) to be played back to the user.

This engine provides the crucial components for bidirectional voice communication, bridging the gap between raw audio and the intelligent processing layers.
