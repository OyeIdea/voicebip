# RevoVoiceAI Platform - Initial Structure

## Introduction

Welcome to the RevoVoiceAI platform! This repository contains the initial structural outline for a sophisticated, microservices-based, cloud-native architecture designed to handle voice interactions, AI processing, and business system integrations.

This document provides a high-level overview of the components structured so far. For more detailed information on specific layers or services, please refer to their respective README files linked below.

## Architectural Layers & Services

So far, we have begun to structure the following key architectural layers and their core services:

### Voice Gateway Layer

The entry point for all voice communications, handling various signaling and media protocols.
See detailed information in the [Voice Gateway Layer README](./voice_gateway_layer/README.md).

**Services Outlined:**
*   **`sip_gateway` (Go Service)**: Handles SIP/RTP protocols for telephony integration.
*   **`webrtc_gateway` (Go Service)**: Enables WebRTC-based real-time communication from browsers/mobile.
*   **`session_manager` (Go Service)**: Provides centralized session tracking for the gateway layer.

### Real-Time Processing Engine

Handles core voice processing and real-time data streaming.
See detailed information in the [Real-Time Processing Engine README](./real_time_processing_engine/README.md).

**Services Outlined:**
*   **`StreamingDataManager`**: Manages incoming data streams (e.g., audio from calls) and routes them to appropriate processing services.
*   **`SpeechToTextService` (STT)**: Transcribes audio streams into text.
*   **`TextToSpeechService` (TTS)**: Converts textual responses into audible speech.
*   *(Note: VAD and Audio Processing Pipeline services are also structured here, but not listed in this top-level summary for brevity. See layer README.)*


### AI/ML Services Layer

Provides the intelligence and decision-making capabilities for the platform.
See detailed information in the [AI/ML Services Layer README](./ai_ml_services/README.md).

**Services Outlined:**
*   **`NLUService` (Natural Language Understanding)**: Processes input text to identify user intents, extract key entities, and manage conversational context.
*   **`DialogueManagementService` (DM)**: Manages the conversation flow, tracks dialogue state, and determines the system's next actions or responses based on NLU output.
*   **`SentimentAnalysisEngineService`**: Dedicated to detecting emotional tone in text.
*   **Specialized AI Services:**
    *   `VoiceCloningService`: For voice model training and custom voice synthesis.
    *   `PredictiveAnalyticsEngine`: For call volume forecasting and customer behavior prediction.
    *   `PersonalizationEngine`: For customer profile analysis and interaction customization.

### Business Logic Layer

Orchestrates application workflows and implements core business rules. Implemented in Python.
See detailed information in the [Business Logic Layer README](./business_logic_layer/README.md).

**Services Outlined:**
*   **`CallManagementServices`**: Manages call routing, session orchestration, and related functionalities.
    *   Includes `CallRoutingService` and `SessionOrchestratorService`.
*   **`CustomerProfileService`**: Manages customer identity, preferences, and interaction history.
*   **`PersonalizationService`**: Handles dynamic content adaptation and context-aware responses.
*   **`RealTimeAgentAssistant`**: Provides live transcription, suggestions, and knowledge base integration for agents.
*   **`PerformanceAnalyticsService`**: Tracks KPIs, monitors quality, and provides training recommendations.

## High-Level Interaction Flow

The core conversational AI pipeline, involving services from these layers, generally follows this sequence:

1.  **Voice Input (via `VoiceGatewayLayer`)**: User speaks; call is established (e.g., via `sip_gateway` (Go Service) or `webrtc_gateway` (Go Service), managed by `session_manager`).
2.  **Stream Management (`StreamingDataManager`)**: Captures and manages the incoming audio stream.
3.  **Speech-to-Text (`SpeechToTextService`)**: Transcribes the audio to text. (VAD and Audio Processing Pipeline may be used here).
4.  **Natural Language Understanding (`NLUService`)**: Interprets the text to understand intent and extract entities. (May incorporate sentiment via `SentimentAnalysisEngineService`).
5.  **Dialogue Management (`DialogueManagementService`)**: Decides the next system action or preliminary response content based on NLU output (including sentiment) and conversation state.
6.  **Call Management (`CallManagementServices`)**: If the DM's decision involves routing or complex session handling (e.g., to an agent or specific queue), the `CallManagementServices` (specifically `CallRoutingService` and `SessionOrchestratorService`) determine the specific target and manage the call flow based on business rules, NLU data, and agent availability.
7.  **Text-to-Speech (`TextToSpeechService`)**: Converts the system's text response (from DM or other business logic, potentially customized by `PersonalizationService`) back into audio.
8.  **Voice Output (via `VoiceGatewayLayer`)**: The synthesized audio is played back to the user (e.g., via `sip_gateway` (Go Service) or `webrtc_gateway` (Go Service), managed by `session_manager`, and RTP/SRTP).

This flow enables a full, bidirectional voice-based interaction.

## Future Work & Next Steps

This repository currently represents only the initial structural skeleton of the RevoVoiceAI platform. Many other components outlined in the full technical architecture document are yet to be structured, including but not limited to:

*   Other services in the Voice Gateway Layer.
*   Remaining services in the Real-Time Processing Engine.
*   Other services in the AI/ML Services Layer (now largely covered with the specialized services).
*   Other services in the Business Logic Layer (now largely covered with customer and agent support services).
*   **Integration Layer** (CRM/ERP connectors, Omnichannel Hub).
*   **Data Management Layer** (Databases, Data Processing pipelines).
*   **Security & Compliance Layer**.
*   **Management & Monitoring Layer**.

Further development will involve implementing the logic within these structured services, integrating actual AI/ML models, setting up communication protocols between services (e.g., gRPC, REST APIs, message queues), and defining the infrastructure for deployment (e.g., Kubernetes).
