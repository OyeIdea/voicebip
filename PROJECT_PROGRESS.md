# RevoVoiceAI Platform - Project Progress

This document tracks the completion of major foundational tasks in structuring the RevoVoiceAI platform. Each item typically includes the creation of service directories, basic API definitions, service-specific READMEs, updates to layer-level READMEs, and the submission of these structural components.

## Completed Foundational Tasks

### Voice Gateway Layer Structures
- [x] Initial structure for `sip_gateway` (Go implementation)
- [x] Initial structure for `webrtc_gateway` (Go implementation)
- [x] Initial structure for `session_manager` (Go implementation)

### Real-Time Processing Engine Structures
- [x] Initial structure for `StreamingDataManager`
- [x] Initial structure for `SpeechToTextService` (STT)
- [x] Initial structure for `TextToSpeechService` (TTS)
- [x] Initial structure for `VADService` (Voice Activity Detection)
- [x] Initial structure for `AudioProcessingPipelineService`

### AI/ML Services Layer Structures
- [x] Initial structure for `NLUService` (Natural Language Understanding)
- [x] Initial structure for `DialogueManagementService` (DM)
- [x] Initial structure for `SentimentAnalysisEngineService`

### Business Logic Layer Structures
- [x] Initial structure for `CallRoutingService` (now part of Call Management Services)

### AI/ML Services Layer Structures (Specialized)
- [x] Initial structure for `VoiceCloningService`
- [x] Initial structure for `PredictiveAnalyticsEngine`
- [x] Initial structure for `PersonalizationEngine`

### Business Logic Layer Structures (Call Management Services)
- [x] Restructured `CallRoutingService` under `CallManagementServices`
- [x] Initial structure for `SessionOrchestratorService`

### Business Logic Layer Structures (Customer Services)
- [x] Initial structure for `CustomerProfileService`
- [x] Initial structure for `PersonalizationService`

### Business Logic Layer Structures (Agent Support Services)
- [x] Initial structure for `RealTimeAgentAssistant`
- [x] Initial structure for `PerformanceAnalyticsService`

### General Project Documentation
- [x] Consolidated Root-Level `README.md`

## Future Tasks

This progress tracker will be updated as more components of the RevoVoiceAI platform are outlined and structured. For a broader overview of all planned components and the project's full scope, please refer to the "Future Work & Next Steps" section in the main [README.md](./README.md).

The next stages of development will involve:
- Implementing the actual logic within these service structures.
- Integrating specific AI/ML models and audio processing libraries.
- Defining and setting up communication protocols between services.
- Structuring and developing other major layers such as the Voice Gateway, Business Logic, Integration, Data Management, Security, and Monitoring layers.
