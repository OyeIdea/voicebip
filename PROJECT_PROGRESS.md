# RevoVoiceAI Platform - Project Progress

This document tracks the completion of major foundational tasks in structuring the RevoVoiceAI platform. Each item typically includes the creation of service directories, basic API definitions, service-specific READMEs, updates to layer-level READMEs, and the submission of these structural components.

## Completed Foundational Tasks

### Voice Gateway Layer Structures
- [x] Initial structure for `sip_gateway` (Go implementation)
- [x] Initial structure for `webrtc_gateway` (Go implementation)
- [x] Initial structure for `session_manager` (Go implementation)

### Real-Time Processing Engine Structures
- [x] Initial structure for `StreamingDataManager`
- [x] Initial structure for `SpeechToTextService` (STT)
- [x] Initial structure for `TextToSpeechService` (TTS)
- [x] Initial structure for `VADService` (Voice Activity Detection)
- [x] Initial structure for `AudioProcessingPipelineService`

### AI/ML Services Layer Structures
- [x] Initial structure for `NLUService` (Natural Language Understanding)
- [x] Initial structure for `DialogueManagementService` (DM)
- [x] Initial structure for `SentimentAnalysisEngineService`

### Business Logic Layer Structures
- [x] Initial structure for `CallRoutingService` (now part of Call Management Services)

### AI/ML Services Layer Structures (Specialized)
- [x] Initial structure for `VoiceCloningService`
- [x] Initial structure for `PredictiveAnalyticsEngine`
- [x] Initial structure for `PersonalizationEngine`

### Business Logic Layer Structures (Call Management Services)
- [x] Restructured `CallRoutingService` under `CallManagementServices`
- [x] Initial structure for `SessionOrchestratorService`

### Business Logic Layer Structures (Customer Services)
- [x] Initial structure for `CustomerProfileService`
- [x] Initial structure for `PersonalizationService`

### Business Logic Layer Structures (Agent Support Services)
- [x] Initial structure for `RealTimeAgentAssistant`
- [x] Initial structure for `PerformanceAnalyticsService`

### General Project Documentation
- [x] Consolidated Root-Level `README.md`

### Voice Gateway Layer Implementation (Basic)
*   **`sip_gateway`**:
    - [x] Basic SIP message handling (INVITE, ACK, BYE)
    - [x] Conceptual RTP stream and Session Manager integration (logging)
    - [x] Initial configuration and unit tests
*   **`webrtc_gateway`**:
    - [x] WebSocket signaling for WebRTC (offer/answer, ICE)
    - [x] Basic Pion WebRTC PeerConnection setup
    - [x] Conceptual Session Manager integration (logging)
    - [x] Initial configuration and unit tests
*   **`session_manager`**:
    - [x] In-memory session store (thread-safe)
    - [x] CRUD operations for sessions
    - [x] HTTP API for session management
    - [x] Initial configuration and unit tests

#### Voice Gateway Layer Enhancements
- **Cross-Service Integration:**
    - [x] `sip_gateway`: Integrated with `session_manager` HTTP API for session lifecycle management.
    - [x] `webrtc_gateway`: Integrated with `session_manager` HTTP API for session lifecycle management.
- **Error Handling & Logging:**
    - [x] All VGW Services: Implemented structured logging for better diagnostics (e.g., `[SERVICE_NAME][LEVEL][Function] Message`).
    - [x] `session_manager`: Introduced specific error types (e.g., `ErrSessionNotFound`, `ErrSessionExists`) and mapped to HTTP status codes (404, 409).
    - [x] `sip_gateway`: Improved error handling for session manager calls (SIP 500 on critical failure) and SIP parsing (SIP 400).
    - [x] `webrtc_gateway`: Improved error handling for session manager calls (WebSocket error on critical failure) and Pion WebRTC API errors.
- **Configuration Management:**
    - [x] All VGW Services: Enabled configuration via environment variables with fallbacks to defaults for ports, addresses, and API endpoints.

## Future Tasks

This progress tracker will be updated as more components of the RevoVoiceAI platform are outlined and structured. For a broader overview of all planned components and the project's full scope, please refer to the "Future Work & Next Steps" section in the main [README.md](./README.md).

The next stages of development will involve:
- Implementing the actual logic within these service structures.
- Integrating specific AI/ML models and audio processing libraries.
- Defining and setting up communication protocols between services.
- Structuring and developing other major layers such as the Voice Gateway, Business Logic, Integration, Data Management, Security, and Monitoring layers.
