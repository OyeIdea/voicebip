# Business Logic Layer

## Purpose

The Business Logic Layer (BLL) is a central part of the RevoVoiceAI platform, responsible for orchestrating application workflows, implementing core business rules, and managing the state and logic that define how the platform behaves beyond the raw processing of voice and AI.

This layer acts as an intermediary between the presentation/gateway layers and the data/AI service layers, ensuring that business processes are followed correctly. Services in this layer are currently planned to be implemented in Python for ease of integration with AI/ML services and general application development.

## Services

The services within this layer handle specific domains of business functionality:

*   **`CallManagementServices`**: Manages call routing, session orchestration, and related functionalities. ([Details](./call_management_services/README.md))

## Customer Services

*   **`CustomerProfileService`**: Manages customer identity, preference storage, and interaction history. ([Details](./customer_profile_service/README.md))
*   **`PersonalizationService`**: Handles dynamic content adaptation and context-aware responses, potentially utilizing the PersonalizationEngine from the AI/ML layer. ([Details](./personalization_service/README.md))

## Agent Support Services

*   **`RealTimeAgentAssistant`**: Provides agents with live transcription, suggestions, and knowledge base integration. ([Details](./real_time_agent_assistant/README.md))
*   **`PerformanceAnalyticsService`**: Tracks KPIs, monitors quality, and provides training recommendations for agent performance. ([Details](./performance_analytics_service/README.md))

## Key Responsibilities

*   **Workflow Orchestration**: Managing multi-step business processes (e.g., complex call flows, customer interaction sequences).
*   **Business Rule Execution**: Applying specific rules that define application behavior (e.g., routing logic, escalation policies, personalization strategies).
*   **Data Aggregation & Transformation**: Combining data from various sources (e.g., CRM, customer profiles, AI service outputs) to make informed decisions.
*   **Interface with Data Layer**: Managing interactions with databases and other data stores for business entities.
*   **State Management**: Handling application-level state that spans multiple interactions or services.

This layer is crucial for tailoring the RevoVoiceAI platform to specific business needs and ensuring consistent operational logic.
