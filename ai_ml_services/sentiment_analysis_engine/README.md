# Sentiment Analysis Engine Service

## Purpose

The Sentiment Analysis Engine Service is a component of the RevoVoiceAI AI/ML Services Layer. Its dedicated function is to analyze textual input to determine the emotional tone or sentiment expressed (e.g., positive, negative, neutral). This information can be crucial for understanding user satisfaction, detecting urgency or frustration, and tailoring responses appropriately.

While basic sentiment might sometimes be incorporated into an NLU service, a dedicated engine allows for more sophisticated or specialized sentiment models and fine-grained analysis.

## Core Functions (Conceptual)

*   **Sentiment Classification**: Categorizes text into predefined sentiment labels (e.g., positive, negative, neutral, or more nuanced emotions like joy, anger, sadness).
*   **Sentiment Scoring**: Provides confidence scores for the detected sentiment(s).
*   **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (Advanced)**: (Future capability) Could identify sentiment towards specific aspects or entities mentioned in the text.

## Components

*   `service.py`: Contains the main `SentimentAnalysisEngineService` class. Its `analyze_sentiment()` method takes text input and returns a structured dictionary containing sentiment labels and scores.
*   `config.py`: (Placeholder) Intended for service-specific configurations, such as paths to sentiment analysis models, language settings, or thresholds for sentiment scores.
*   `models/`: (Placeholder directory) Intended to store sentiment analysis model files, lexicons, or related assets.
*   `__init__.py`: Makes the directory a Python package.

## Interaction with Other Services

The Sentiment Analysis Engine Service can be utilized by various other components:

*   **Natural Language Understanding (NLU) Service**: The `NLUService` might call this engine to enrich its output with sentiment information. Alternatively, they could operate in parallel, with their outputs being combined later.
*   **Dialogue Management (DM) Service**: The `DialogueManagementService` can use sentiment data to:
    *   Adapt response strategies (e.g., be more empathetic if negative sentiment is detected).
    *   Trigger escalations or alerts if strong negative sentiment persists.
    *   Prioritize certain user requests.
*   **Analytics & Monitoring**: Sentiment data from interactions can be logged and aggregated for analytics, providing insights into customer experience, agent performance, or product feedback.
*   **Real-time Agent Assist**: In an agent-assisted scenario, real-time sentiment analysis can provide cues to the human agent.

This service will integrate with specific sentiment analysis libraries or pre-trained models (e.g., VADER, TextBlob, Hugging Face Transformers models fine-tuned for sentiment).
